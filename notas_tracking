1. Resize the captured image (width/4,height/4, this will reduce a lot of the noise and will speed up the processing time)
2. Obtain the binary image with cvInRangeS (not with cvThreshold)
3. Dilate the image a couple of times
4. Use the functions that cvblobslib library provide to detect blobs, filter small blobs and so on... (you can find sample code on how to do that)
5. Draw a rectangle around the biggest blob on the original image(taking in consideration the resizing factor)
